To fix the issue with creating a new task after adding the task_type association, we need to ensure that the Task model is properly set up to reference the TaskType, and that the form is sending the correct parameters.

Steps to Fix the Issue:
Ensure Foreign Key in tasks Table:
Make sure the tasks table has a task_type_id column. If you haven't already added this column, generate a migration to add it:

bash
Copy code
rails generate migration AddTaskTypeToTasks task_type:references
rails db:migrate
This will create a task_type_id column in your tasks table, linking each task to a task type.

Update Task Model:
Make sure the Task model has the belongs_to association with TaskType:

ruby
Copy code
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :task_type, optional: true # Optional if you want to allow tasks without a type
  has_many :comments
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :comments, allow_destroy: true

  # Other task logic
end
Update the Form:
Make sure your task form is passing the task_type_id correctly. In app/views/tasks/_form.html.erb, update the task type selection to this:

erb
Copy code
<div class="field">
  <%= form.label :task_type_id, "Task Type" %>
  <%= form.collection_select :task_type_id, TaskType.all, :id, :type, { include_blank: true }, class: "form-control" %>
</div>
This will pass the task_type_id (not task_type) to the controller.

Check Strong Parameters in the Controller:
Ensure that your TasksController is allowing task_type_id as a permitted parameter. In app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb, update the task_params method:

ruby
Copy code
def task_params
  params.require(:task).permit(:task_name, :status, :task_type_id, :username, comments_attributes: [:id, :content, :_destroy])
end
This ensures that task_type_id is allowed when creating or updating tasks.

Test Task Creation:
After these changes, try creating a new task again. If everything is set up correctly, the task should be created with the selected task type.

Conclusion:
By ensuring that the task_type_id is properly passed through the form and permitted in the controller, you should now be able to create tasks without issues. Let me know if you encounter any further problems!
